## Hi there I'm Yair 👋

I’m a full-stack / systems-minded software engineer with a Computer Engineering background and a track record of building end-to-end internal tools—from data architecture to polished UI/UX. I enjoy turning complex network + operational data into products that improve reliability, reduce MTTR, and make teams faster.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about prototyping, IoT/edge experimentation, and shipping practical tools that people actually use.

## Portfolio

### Notable Work (Selected)

#### Reliability & Experience Tooling (Internal)
- **E2E UX Status Application:** Led development across **data architecture + engineering + UI/UX + stakeholder management**, designed to strengthen reliability practices and operational visibility; targeted meaningful efficiency gains.
- **Frontline Sentiment / Issue Capture App:** Architected a scalable solution to reduce mean time to resolve incidents by enabling structured, high-signal input from frontline users. Implemented with **FastAPI** in a **Python-based Azure Function App**, designed for high concurrency.
- **Feedback + Insights Platform:** Integrated **MongoDB** with **Go, JavaScript, and Python** APIs; optimized storage/retrieval for **1M+ feedback entries**. Built a dynamic system that surfaces **role- and location-relevant issues** to improve engagement and actionability.
- Drove iterative delivery with stakeholder demos, feedback loops, and rapid iteration to ensure adoption.

#### Internal Open-Source Big Data API Platform
- Built and released an internal open-source API platform to pull and analyze large-scale telecom/network datasets (multi-vendor footprint; national-scale telemetry).
- Adopted by **multiple VP orgs**, used by **many teams and projects**, and helped replace vendor tooling—contributing to **multi-million dollar cost savings**.
